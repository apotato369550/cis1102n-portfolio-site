            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              Number systems play an underrated yet critical role in both
              computing and everyday life. While the decimal system is familiar
              and widely used in daily tasks like shopping, cooking, and
              financial planning, the binary, octal, and hexadecimal systems
              often go unnoticed despite being foundational to modern
              technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Binary is the core language of computers, enabling everything from
              basic data processing to complex algorithms that power the
              internet, AI, and digital communication. Hexadecimal simplifies
              binary data, making it essential for programming, debugging, and
              memory management. Although often invisible to the average person,
              these number systems are integral to the smooth operation of our
              devices and networks, quietly driving innovation and convenience
              in our connected world.

            <h4>What Are Number Systems?</h4>
            <p>
              A number system is a mathematical framework used to represent
              numbers in a structured format. It defines how digits are arranged
              and what base is used for representing numbers. The most common
              number systems include decimal (base-10), binary (base-2), octal
              (base-8), and hexadecimal (base-16), each with different
              applications depending on their use in daily life or in computing.

            <h4>Decimal Number System (Base 10)</h4>
            <p>
              This is the most widely used system in daily life. It consists of
              ten digits (0-9). Each digit's place represents a power of 10,
              making it intuitive for humans to use. The decimal system is
              essential for financial calculations, measurements, and many other
              aspects of life (MathMonks, 2024).
            </p>
            <p>
              It is the primary number system for human usage due to its
              compatibility with natural counting, measurements, and everyday
              calculations.

            <h4>Binary Number System (Base 2)</h4>
            <p>
              Binary uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It is fundamental in
              computing because computers operate on binary logic. All digital
              devices, such as smartphones and laptops, process data in binary
              format (Knuth, 1998; MathMonks, 2024).
            </p>
            <p>
              The binary system is crucial for computers and digital devices, as
              it directly correlates with electronic circuits and logic gates
              used in hardware (Kosheleva, 2012).

        <div class="topic">
          <div class="topic-text">
            <h4>Octal Number System (Base 8)</h4>
            <p>
              Octal uses digits from 0 to 7 and was historically used in
              computing, particularly in older systems. It is sometimes still
              used for grouping binary digits into a simpler form for
              readability and processing (Kosheleva & Kreinovich, 2019).
            </p>
            <p>
              Though less common today, octal is used for simplifying binary
              code, especially when dealing with older systems. It helps
              programmers interpret long binary sequences more efficiently.

          <div class="topic-text">
            <h4>Hexadecimal (Base 16)</h4>
            <p>
              Hexadecimal uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F to represent values
              10-15. It is widely used in programming and computer science to
              simplify binary data representation, reducing long binary strings
              into shorter and more readable sequences (MathMonks, 2024;
              Kosheleva & Villaverde, 2018).
            </p>
            <p>
              Hexadecimal is significant for reducing complex binary code into a
              more manageable form, which is crucial in computer programming and
              memory addressing (Laudon & Laudon, 2020).

            <p>
              Computer science is the study of computers and computational
              systems. It is a broad field which includes everything from the
              algorithms that make up software to how software interacts with
              hardware to how well software is developed and designed. Computer
              scientists use various mathematical algorithms, coding procedures,
              and their expert programming skills to study computer processes
              and develop new software and systems.

            <h4>Computer Science (CS)</h4>
            <p>
              As the foundational discipline, computer science focuses on the
              study of algorithms, data structures, software design, and the
              architecture of computing systems. It is a dynamic field that
              drives innovation in artificial intelligence, machine learning,
              and more. (Michigan Technological University, 2024)

              Computer Engineering bridges the gap between computer science and
              electrical engineering, focusing on the design, development, and
              integration of hardware and software systems. Computer engineers
              work on creating the physical components of computers, such as
              processors and memory devices, as well as the software that runs
              on these devices. According to the Institute of Electrical and
              Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Computer Engineering is essential
              for the development of everything from microprocessors to embedded
              systems, which are critical in devices ranging from smartphones to
              medical equipment . (McCartney, 2024)

            <h4>Information Technology (IT)</h4>
            <p>
              Information technology (IT) is the use of computers, storage,
              networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and
              processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms
              of electronic data. Typically, IT is used in the context of
              business operations, as opposed to the technology used for
              personal or entertainment purposes. The commercial use of IT
              encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.

              Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals
              with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software
              applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and
              knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for
              end users.Software Engineering is concerned with the systematic
              development and maintenance of software. It involves applying
              engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain
              software systems that are reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.
              The importance of software engineering is underscored by its role
              in building the applications and platforms that power everything
              from mobile devices to large-scale enterprise systems . (Michigan

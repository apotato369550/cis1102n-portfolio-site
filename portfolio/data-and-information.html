            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, understanding the
              concepts of data, information, and information systems is critical
              for both academic and professional success. These foundational
              elements form the backbone of how modern organizations operate,
              providing the necessary tools and frameworks for effective
              decision-making. As businesses continue to rely heavily on digital
              systems to process and analyze data, the distinction between data
              and information becomes increasingly significant. Additionally,
              various types of support systems within information systems are
              essential for ensuring that decision-makers at all levels have the
              right information at the right time.

            <h4>Data Defined</h4>
            <p>
              Data refers to raw, unorganized facts that need to be processed to
              become meaningful. These facts can be in the form of numbers,
              text, images, or other formats and, in isolation, hold limited
              value. Information, on the other hand, is data that has been
              processed, organized, and structured in a way that adds meaning or
              context, making it useful for decision-making.

            <h4>Information Defined</h4>
            <p>
              The transformation from data to information involves analysis and
              interpretation, where data is filtered, summarized, and presented
              in a format that makes it actionable for users (Kroenke & Boyle,
              2019; Stair & Reynolds, 2020). In essence, while data is the raw
              input, information is the valuable output that informs decisions
              and actions.

            <h4>Information Systems</h4>
            <p>
              An Information System (IS) is a structured system designed to
              collect, store, process, and disseminate information. It comprises
              several components, including hardware, software, databases, human
              resources, and procedures, each contributing to the system’s
              overall functionality. The primary purpose of an IS is to support
              business operations, decision-making, and management functions
              within an organization (Laudon & Laudon, 2020; Stair & Reynolds,
              2020). IS can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an
              organization, providing the infrastructure to handle the
              complexities of data management and ensuring that accurate
              information is available to the right people at the right time.

            <h4>Different Types of Support Systems in Information Systems</h4>
            <p>
              Support systems within Information Systems are specialized tools
              designed to assist various levels of management in making
              decisions. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)</li>
              <li>Management Information Systems (MIS)</li>
              <li>Decision Support Systems (DSS)</li>
              <li>Executive Information Systems (EIS)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These support systems are integral to an organization's ability to
              adapt and respond to its environment, ensuring that managers and
              executives at all levels have the information they need to make
              informed decisions. As technology continues to evolve, the
              capabilities of these systems are expanding, offering more
              advanced analytics, real-time data processing, and increasingly
              intuitive interfaces (Haag & Cummings, 2020).

            <h4>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)</h4>
            <p>
              TPS handle the day-to-day operations by processing business
              transactions such as sales, receipts, cash deposits, payroll,
              credit decisions, and flow of materials (Laudon & Laudon, 2020).

            <h4>Management Information Systems (MIS)</h4>
            <p>
              MIS provide routine information to managers, typically in the form
              of reports, to help them make structured decisions and manage
              daily operations effectively. These systems focus on internal
              sources of information and primarily report on the past and
              present performance (Stair & Reynolds, 2020).

            <h4>Decision Support Systems (DSS)</h4>
            <p>
              DSS are more analytical, providing tools and data to support
              complex decision-making processes. These systems are designed to
              handle semi-structured or unstructured problems, where
              decision-makers need to analyze data from various sources and
              perspectives (Valacich & Schneider, 2018).

            <h4>Executive Information Systems (EIS)</h4>
            <p>
              EIS cater to the needs of senior executives, offering easy access
              to both internal and external information relevant to strategic
              goals. These systems are designed to provide a high-level view of
              the organization’s performance, often incorporating dashboards and
              data visualization tools for quick insights (Laudon & Laudon,
              2020).

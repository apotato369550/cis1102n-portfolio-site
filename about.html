            <h4>Who are We?</h4>
            <p>
              CompuFoundations is a dedicated project crafted by John Andre Yap, a BSCS 1 student who is passionate about Computer Science. This project was built in fulfillment for the requirements of the CIS 1102N Course. This platform brings together everything we’ve learned from our introductory course in computing, encompassing the core pillars of the field. Here, we cover foundational topics such as the essentials of computer science, number systems, data and information systems, as well as hardware, software, and the types of computers and motherboards that power our technology today.
